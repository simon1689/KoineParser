# Koine Parser

Live: www.KoineParser.com

This is a project which I created because I wanted to achieve a goal. I set the goal to read, translate, and parse 1-3 John by the end of 2020, but there was no tool to help me parse through biblical texts.
I came across [MasterGreek.com](https://mastergreek.com), but it did not offer parsing for biblical text. This project offers the solution.

Many GitHub projects made this possible, especially:
<ul>
  <li>The Greek text is from <a href="https://github.com/bibleforge/BibleForgeDB">BibleForgeDB</a> with the
      morphological codes of Robinson
    </li>
    <li>
      Various parts of the following projects:
      <ul>
        <li>The OpenGNT project which is tremendous: <a href="https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT">GitHub</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Dodson-Greek-Lexicon">Jeffrey Dodson's Greek Lexicon</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/billmounce/dictionary">William D. Mounce's Lexicon</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

I've also included MySQL database exports in /databases for the database I've used.
